# FRIDAY - The AI Brain (Chrome Extension v1)



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc85ea34-2901-4835-bafa-3b6e95094693



FRIDAY is the visual brain for a new kind of AI assistant — fully reactive, voice-enabled, and built to evolve.  
This is the first version of the project, delivered as a Chrome extension for fast iteration and concept validation.

## 🧠 What It Is

FRIDAY is a voice-interactive 3D neural core that listens, reacts, and responds to your speech in real time.  
It’s built using Web APIs and Three.js, with a glowing brain that visually enters a "thinking" state when processing input.

> This is just the beginning — FRIDAY v2 will become a full Unity-based desktop assistant.
